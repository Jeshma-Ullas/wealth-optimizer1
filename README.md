# Wealth Optimizer

Financial Simulator: The core of the Wealth Optimizer is its financial simulator. This tool simulates each year of an individual's life, taking into account various financial factors and decisions. By running simulations, users can analyze different scenarios and determine the most optimal strategies for wealth accumulation and tax minimization.

Income Simulation: The simulator assumes a continuous income stream throughout an individual's working years. It considers pay raises as constant, though it acknowledges this as unrealistic for real-world scenarios. Any excess income beyond expenses is allocated to a taxable account for further investment.

Tax Optimization: The simulator incorporates strategies for optimizing taxes both during the accumulation phase and in retirement. Before Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) in retirement, it recommends Roth IRA conversions to maximize assets at death. During RMDs, it suggests withdrawing at least the standard deduction amount, which is taxed at a 0% rate. Excess RMDs are transferred to a taxable account, where they continue to grow at the same interest rate as retirement accounts. Tax calculations consider only standard deductions and two filing statuses: "single" and "married."

Investment and Retirement Accounts: The simulator manages various retirement accounts, including traditional 401(k), Roth IRA, and taxable accounts. It calculates contributions, employer matches, and withdrawals based on user-specified parameters, such as income, contribution limits, and employer benefits.

Interest and Growth: The simulator assumes a steady growth rate for investments without considering market volatility. Interest is applied annually to account balances, and spending is adjusted for inflation to maintain purchasing power.
